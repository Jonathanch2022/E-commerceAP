üõí E-Commerce REST API (Flask + MySQL)
This project is a RESTful API built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Marshmallow, designed to manage users, products, and orders for an e-commerce platform. The API connects to a MySQL database and supports full CRUD operations, as well as order-to-product relationships.

üõ† Notes
The app uses SQLAlchemy's ORM to define relationships.

Marshmallow is used to serialize/deserialize and validate incoming JSON data.

Routes are organized by resource type (users, products, orders).

Adding duplicate products to an order is prevented by checking existence in the join table before insert.
